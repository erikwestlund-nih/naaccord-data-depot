# SAML test certificates (never commit production certs)
# saml_certs_test/ is intentionally committed for development convenience
# Production certs should be handled through secure deployment pipelines

# SAML attribute mappings are shared between dev and production
# saml_attribute_mappings/ is committed as it contains configuration, not secrets

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Deployment Keys and Certificates
# Block entire deploy/keys/ directory by default (protects production secrets)

# ✅ EXCEPTION: Explicitly allow TEST/DEV certificates (safe to commit)
